## Our Product: Oilert
### Overview
Oilert is an intelligent car maintenance tracking app designed to help users log mileage, oil changes, and other routine vehicle upkeep tasks. Think of it as version control for your vehicle, providing accurate tracking to help car owners extend the life of their vehicles, reduce CO2 emissions, and save money.

### Features
  - **Multi-Vehicle Support** – Track multiple cars in a single app
  - **Fuel Logging & MPG Calculation** – Monitor fuel efficiency over time
  - **Maintenance Reminders** – Set alerts for oil changes, tire rotations, and more
  - **Service History Tracking** – Keep a detailed log of past maintenance
  - **Secure and Verifiable Records** – Implementing encryption and digital signatures to create tamper-proof maintenance logs, ensuring trustworthy service history for vehicle owners

### Why It Matters
Regular vehicle maintenance is essential for longevity and cost savings. By providing data-driven maintenance tracking, Oilert helps users:
  - Ensuring necessary oil change maintenance, preventing expensive repairs
  - Maintain a reliable service history, potentially increasing resale value
  - Extend vehicle lifespan, reducing CO2 emissions

Studies have shown that extending vehicle lifespans significantly reduces CO2 emissions.
Research from ScienceDirect found that increasing the average vehicle lifetime to 15.8 years in key countries could reduce emissions by 17 Mt-CO2-eq (Yuya Nakamoto, 2019) . Similarly, NIEHS highlights that a longer vehicle lifespan decreases total life-cycle emissions, countering the assumption that replacing vehicles more often is environmentally beneficial (Kagawa S, 2011).

From an economic perspective, the University of Michigan found that extending vehicle
ownership from 4 to 18 years could reduce ownership costs by 50% per mile (Spitzley, 2004). This means fewer expenses for consumers and a more sustainable approach
to vehicle management.

### What We Accomplished in 24 Hours
While we were unable to fully implement a working application within the hackathon timeframe, we gained valuable insights into the project’s scope and technical requirements. We refined our project vision, established a clear data structure, and improved our team coordination by resolving initial miscommunications. By the end of the event, we had a solid foundation that we can build upon to develop a fully functional application in the future.

### The Future
Our goal is to evolve Oilert into a comprehensive vehicle maintenance management tool. Future enhancements will include:
  - **Expanded Maintenance Tracking** – Monitoring oil changes, filter replacements, coolant levels, and other critical services based on real usage data and manufacturer guidelines.
  - **Predictive Service Alerts** – Utilizing historical data to anticipate maintenance needs, similar to how we calculate miles per gallon.
  - **Cloud Integration** – Allowing multi-device access and automatic data backup
  - **Industry Adoption** – Creating a scalable solution for automotive bussinesses and fleet management.

With further development, Oilert has the potential to become an industry-standard solution for vehicle upkeep, providing data-driven insights and secure maintenance tracking for individual users and automotive businesses alike.
